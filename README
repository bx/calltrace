calltrace is a gdb plugin to track flow of function calls and returns in a style similar to DTrace flowindent, but with an output that can be manipulated using (emacs) orgmode. It requires gdb with python2, and an unstripped executable (with symbol information).


USAGE
> gdb -ex 'python execfile("<path/to/calltrace.py>")' <path/to/executable>

to save output to a file:
(gdb) calltrace log <path/to/logfile.org>

to tell calltrace to print source code path/line number information:
(gdb) calltrace sourceinfo

to tell calltrace not to print return addresses or source code information
(gdb) calltrace minimal

to execute:
(gdb) r <your arguments>
OR
(gdb) calltrace

Results are printed in a way so they can be easily manipulated via emacs orgmode.


EXAMPLE

Suppose you have build an executable called hello from the following source:
"""
#include <stdio.h>

void say_hello() {
  printf("hello, world!\n");
}

int main() {
  say_hello();
  return 0;
}
"""

You can then get the call trace via:
> gdb -ex 'python execfile("path/to/calltrace.py")' hello

EMACS SUPPORT

You can view the script's output with any text editor, but it is best viewed with emacs org-mode and the calltrace.el elisp file loaded.

calltrace.el provides functions to help you better understand the call
trace output by hiding duplicate adjacent function calls. It does not
(yet) check to see that the subcalls of any two matching adjacent
function calls have the same structure, but it should not be hard to
add that feature.

To hide and merge matching adjacent function calls (note: this may take a while and emacs may appear to freeze while it is running):
M-x ct-collapse-dups-until-none

Matching adjacent function calls are marked with an ARCHIVE tag in
order to harness org-mode's automatic hiding of subtrees of nodes
marked with the tag ARCHIVE.  You can save the file so you don't have
to run any tagging stripts in the future.  Emacs will not remember the
visibility state of everything in future sessions, but you can execute
the expression (ct-collapse-dups-until-none t) in order to instruct
emacs to more thoroughly hide duplicate adjacent function calls.

M-: (ct-collapse-dups-until-none t) [Enter]


If you wish to remove all of the ARCHIVE tags:
M-x (ct-remove-all-hide-tags)

Hidden headlines are collapsed into a {hidden} tag. You can use the tab key to toggle visibility and C+tab to toggle visibility of ARCHIVe subtrees.

These scripts try not to mess with any extra notes or annotations you have added to the file (beside ARCHIVE tags), but this claim has yet to be tested.

Enjoy at your own risk!
